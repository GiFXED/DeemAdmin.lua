How to add a plugin to situation admin  
  
A folder named "situation_plugins" will be created upon execution.<br>
To create a plugin you will need to create a new file as <command_name>.lua such as "help.lua".<br>
Situation admin will treat every lua file within the folder as a function, whatever is inside the file is what is gets ran whenever you execute the command.<br>
The name of the file will be what the command is called for example if the file is named "example.lua" to run the command you would type "command" in the input
