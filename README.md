# How to add plugins to situation admin
<hr>
<p>
A folder named "situation_plugins" will be created upon execution.<br>
To create a plugin you will need to create a new file as <command_name>.lua such as "help.lua".<br>
Treat the entire file as a function, as whatever is inside it is what is going to be ran whenever you execute the command.
